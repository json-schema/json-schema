<p>The work accomplished here are done by volunteers and it would certainly overcome several obstacles if an income was
    available. Unfortunately we do not currently have any way for you to contribute by making a donation, maybe you would help us by
    motivating on <a id="link-issues-strategy" href="https://github.com/json-schema/json-schema/issues">
    the issue tracker</a> why you think we should accept donations, we are all fairly new at open source and any word
    of wisdom goes a long way.</p>

<p>This option was made available, in absence of any means to actually make a transaction, but to still allow for others
    like yourself who really want to contribute but can't find anything they listed which they feel they can do.</p>

<p>Your kind notion never-less won't go unnoticed, even though we can't accept any donation the sheer act of clicking
    through has recorded intent and we will be able to see your noble gesture revealed as an increased hit on the usage
    statistics for this URL.</p>

<p>This in itself is already a huge compliment. Thank you! You rock!</p>
