<p>Let's pretend we're interacting with a JSON based product catalog. This catalog has a product which has an <em>id</em>, a <em>name</em>, a <em>price</em>, and an optional set of <em>tags</em>.
</p>

<h3>Example JSON data for a product API</h3>
<p>An example product in this API is:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/4337461.js"></script>

<p>While generally straightforward, that example leaves some open questions. For example, one may ask:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is id?</li>
  <li>Is name required?</li>
  <li>Can price be 0?</li>
  <li>Are all tags strings?</li>
</ul>

<p>When you're talking about a data format, you want to have metadata about what fields mean, and what valid inputs for those fields are. JSON schema is a specification for standardizing how to answer those questions for JSON data.</p>
<h3>Example schema for the product API</h3>
<p>To start a schema definition, let's begin with a basic to JSON schema.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/4336909.js"></script>

<p>The above schema has a <em>description</em> saying we are going to describe a product, a <em>type</em> saying our product is a JSON object (versus a simple datapoint like a string/number), and a <em>properties</em>section for describing the data in that object.</p>

<p>Next let's answer our previous questions about this API, starting with id.</p>

<h4>What is id?</h4>
<p><em>id</em> is a numeric value that uniquely identifies a product. Since this is the canonical identifier for a product, it doesn't make sense to have a product without one, so it is required.</p>

<p>In JSON Schema terms, we can update our schema to:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/4336918.js"></script>

<h4>Is name required?</h4>
<p><em>name</em> is a string value that describes a product. Since there isn't much to a product, it also is required. Adding this gives us the schema:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/4336933.js"></script>

<h4>Can price be 0?</h4>
<p>According to Acme's docs, there are no free products. In JSON schema a number can have a minimum, and by default minimum is exclusive of the minimum value. Therefore we can update our schema with <em>price</em>:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/4336945.js"></script>

<h4>Are all tags strings?</h4>
<p>Finally, we come to the tags property. Unlike the previous properties, tags have many values, and is represented as a JSON array. According to Acme's docs, all tags must be strings, but you aren't required to specify tags. Since <em>required</em> is an optional attribute of a propery (ironically), we can leave it out of the tags definition, giving us:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/4336949.js"></script>

<h3>Example summary</h3>
<p>The above example is by no means definitive of all the types of data JSON schema can define. For more definitive information see the <a href="#definitions">full standard draft</a>.</p>

<p>As a final example, here's a spec for an array of products, with the products having 2 new properties. The first is a <em>dimensions</em> property for the size of the product, and the second is a <em>warehouseLocation</em> field for where the warehouse that stores them is geographically located.</p>

<p>And also, since JSON Schema defines a reference schema for a geographic location, instead of coming up with our own, we'll reference the <a href="http://json-schema.org/geo">canonical one</a>.</p>
