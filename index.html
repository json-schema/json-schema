<h2>What is JSON Schema</h2>

<p>JSON Schema is a JSON based format for describing JSON data. JSON Schema is to JSON as XSD is to XML.</p>

<p>JSON Schema is a proposed Internet draft defining a JSON media type (application/schema+json) with the following goals:</p>

<dl class="dl-horizontal">
<dt>Validation</dt> <dd>You can use JSON Schema to validate your JSON data.</dd>
<dt>Documentation</dt> <dd>You can extract documentation information from a JSON
Schema, match this documentation to your data, and use that information for user
interaction.</dd>
<dt>Hyperlinking</dt> <dd>You can pair your JSON data with the defining JSON
Schema to build hyperlinks into parts of that JSON data.</dd>
</dl>
<h2>JSON Schema by example</h2>

<p>Let's pretend we're interacting with a JSON based product catalog. This catalog has a...

<h2 id="definitions">JSON Schema standards route</h2>

<p>The last IETF published draft was <a id="link-draft-zyp-json-schema-03"
href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-zyp-json-schema-03">v3</a> which expired on
May 26, 2011 as is the nature of drafts.
    In response to a request by two json schema hacktivists, after creating the
    <a id="link-github-json-schema" href="https://github.com/json-schema">json-schema project</a>
    on github in August 2012, Kris Zyp and Gary Court,
    with their blessings bestowed, sponsored the <a href="#">json-schema.org</a> domain
    and the <a id="link-google-groups2" href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/json-schema">
    json-schema google group</a> to the json-schema community, symbolizing a passing of the
    flame to the next torch bearers. Now committed to see json-schema specification
    through to official RFC acceptance once and for all.</p>

<p><strong>The goal</strong>, to realize the official json schema specification to RFC acceptance.</p>
<p><strong>The strategy</strong>, a first time right approach, by merging the existing community under a
    single banner to encourage and facilitate involvement as a combined team effort;
    frequent release of previews for public review and to reach majority consensus,
    akin to the official IETF process and; the combined specification divided into
    manageable and separate bite sized volumes with specific focus and context to
    simplify execution, consumption and acceptance driven in parallel by volunteers
    with particular interest and buy-in there in.</p>

<p>We would love to hear your thoughts/suggestions/ideas/concerns about our strategy, please
    start a discussion on <a id="link-issues-strategy" href="https://github.com/json-schema/json-schema/issues">
    the issue tracker</a> and meet your fellow json-schema aficionados.</p>

<p>The following volumes have already received active attention. Once we are happy that you
are happy then hopefully the official submission would be no more than a formality.</p>

 <dl id="review-volumes" class="dl-horizontal span8">
     <dt><a id="link-props-core"
href="https://raw.github.com/json-schema/json-schema/next/proposals/json-schema-core.txt">
         json-schema-core</a>
     </dt><dd> Introduces JSON schema, states purpose, defines its IANA media type, the schema
     document and main keywords, nesting and relations of schemas, its primitive data types
     and their equality definitions. Additionally it introduces the separate document approach and
     sets formal guidelines.</dd>
     <dt><a id="link-props-validate"
href="https://raw.github.com/json-schema/json-schema/next/proposals/json-schema-validation.txt">
         json-schema-validation</a>
     </dt><dd> Introduces schema validation and establishes interoperability guidelines. Specifies
     the validation related keywords specific to each primitive data type, includes meta
     information, semantics and relationships.</dd>
     <dt><a id="link-props-hyper"
            href="https://raw.github.com/json-schema/json-schema/next/proposals/json-schema-hypermedia.txt">
         json-schema-hypermedia</a>
     </dt><dd>Introduces the concept of hypermedia and defines its application on JSON data. It encompasses
     links, relation types, content types and includes data submission guidelines.</dd>
</dl>

<p> Each preview release is accompanied by a release notification on <a id="link-issues-preview"
    href="https://github.com/json-schema/json-schema/issues">the issue tracker</a> which is where you are
    given the opportunity to raise any concerns, point out discrepancies or similar fallacies, identify
    missing, incomplete or ambiguity and it cannot be stressed enough just how important your involvement
    is to our inevitable success or forever hold your peace, instead.
</p>

<p>JSON Schema also uses two other specifications, both currently still under review by the IETF:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-pbryan-zyp-json-ref-02">JSON
Reference</a></li>
<li><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-appsawg-json-pointer-03">JSON
Pointer</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>JSON Schema based Implementation libraries</h2>

<p>We maintain a convenience <a id="link-implementations" href="implementations.html">list of JSON Schema based solutions</a>
strategically as indisputable proof of real world implementations in support of the necessity for a standards specification
doubling as a one stop shop for all things JSON Schema clearly highlighting the indicators one would normally use to
assess the health of a project. (work in progress)  </p>

<p>Ideally this simple artifact would become an inspiration for solution developers to improve the quality of
their products by providing a commonsensical and easily obtainable checklist of mini milestones for excellence. Not only
a measurable non-biased comparison ranking but a notable raise of the acceptance bar right across the board
